Recently, I've been seeing this parallax effect being used quite often on Wordpress websites. Let's recreate this subtle parallax effect using React and Motion.

## Initializing the project

First, we will be creating our project and installing some packages.

* Let's start with creating our app using NextJS by running `npx create-next-app@latest` in the terminal.
* Next we install the [Motion](https://motion.dev/docs/react-quick-start) library by running `npm i motion`.
* We will be using [Lenis](https://github.com/darkroomengineering/lenis/blob/main/README.md) to enable smooth scrolling for a better user experience by running `npm i lenis`.
