Hey there! Welcome to my personal blog. It's a place on the internet which I can call "my own". The purpose of building this website was to not only delve deeper into the world of ReactJS and TailwindCSS, but also to use it as a great learning experience for building something from scratch and watching it come to fruition. The beauty of building a personal website is that it can be whatever I want it to be, while also being the owner of my content.

## The Tech Stack

Before even writing a single line of code, I had to decide on what technologies to use for the website. Honestly, it was both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand a blessing, because there are so many awesome free and open source tools available, but on the other hand also a curse for the exact same reason. How do you know what to pick when being presented with a near infinite amount of options?
