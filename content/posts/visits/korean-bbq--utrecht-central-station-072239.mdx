Tried Korean BBQ at the newly opened Seoul Sista in Utrecht. The food was flavorful and lived up to expectations, and while the service showed some inexperience, it was still friendly and attentiveâ€”understandable for a fresh opening. The location is super convenient, right next to the Central Station hall, making it an easy stop for a satisfying meal. Nice to finally have a solid Korean BBQ option nearby without needing to head to Rotterdam or Amsterdam.
