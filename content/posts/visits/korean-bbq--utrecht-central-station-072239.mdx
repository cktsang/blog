Trying out **Korean BBQ** at  **Seoul Sista** **in Utrecht**. The food was, as expected, good and the service was fine too—although a bit inexperienced. Not surprising, since they only just recently opened this restaurant. It’s nice to have an extra option nearby without needing to go to Rotterdam or Amsterdam to get my Korean barbecue fix in.
