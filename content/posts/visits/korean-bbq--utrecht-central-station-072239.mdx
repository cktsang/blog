I finally checked out that new Seoul Sista place in Utrecht for some Korean BBQ. The food was actually really good and lived up to what I'd heard. The staff seemed a little new to everything, but they were still nice and helpful, which you kind of expect from a brand new spot.

It’s in a great location too, basically right next to Utrecht Central Station, so it's a super easy place to stop for a big meal. I'm just glad there's finally a good KBBQ spot in town so I don't have to head over to Rotterdam or Amsterdam anymore.
