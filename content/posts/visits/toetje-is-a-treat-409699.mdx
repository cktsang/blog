Toetje is this tiny, cozy cafe hidden away in the middle of Utrecht where you can grab a great coffee and some homemade cake, if you can actually find a seat! They have a lot of different hot and cold drinks, and their dessert menu changes every day so there’s always something new to try. Since it was so freezing out today, I just went with a caffe mocha to warm up.
