Tucked away in the heart of **Utrecht, Toetje** is a tiny, cozy café where you can enjoy a **great** **cup of** **coffee and a homemade cake**—if you're lucky enough to snag a seat! They offer a wide selection of hot and cold drinks, and their desserts menu changes daily, keeping things fresh and exciting. On this chilly winter day, I opted for just a drink—a **caffè mocha**, the perfect warm-up in the cold.
