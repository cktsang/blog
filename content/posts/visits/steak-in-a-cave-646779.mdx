Located on the **Oudegracht in Utrecht**, this **steakhouse** is arguably the best in the region. One of the rare places where the meat effortlessly falls off the bone and tastes truly exceptional. A must-go when visiting the city. 

**Recommendation:**

* **Tenderloin steak**
* **Baby ribs**
* **Lamsrump**
