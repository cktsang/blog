Went to Copenhagen for the first-ever Counter-Strike 2 Major—and used it as the perfect excuse to explore another European city. The bike lanes are seriously impressive, maybe even better than the ones in the Netherlands. They're completely separated from traffic with barriers, making it one of the safest places I've ever biked through. Also, it’s wild that there's a full-on amusement park, Tivoli, right in the heart of the city!
