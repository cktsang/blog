Visiting Copenhagen for the first Counter-Strike 2 major. It was a great excuse to explore another city in Europe. The bicycle roads might be even better than the ones in the Netherlands. They're separated with a blockade from the main road where the cars drive â€” definitely one of the safest cities to explore on a bike. It's also crazy that there is an amusement park, Tivoli, right in the middle of the city center!
