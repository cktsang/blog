I went to Copenhagen for the first Counter-Strike 2 Major and used it as a great excuse to check out a new city. The bike lanes there are crazy good, maybe even better than the ones back home in the Netherlands. They have actual barriers to keep you away from the cars, so I felt super safe biking around. Also, it is so cool that there is a whole amusement park called Tivoli right in the middle of the city!
