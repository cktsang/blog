I just got back from a two and a half week trip to Hong Kong and Beijing! It had been forever since I was last in Hong Kong, but it honestly felt pretty much the same as I remembered. It’s definitely a bit more modern now, but it still has those same quirky traditions, like having to shout at the minibus driver when you want to get off or rinsing your own chopsticks and bowls before a dim sum meal.

One huge difference I noticed is the updated MTR system. Places that used to require a long bus ride are now just a quick metro trip away, and it even connects the major cities across the region. It is easily the best way to get around and see more of the country, and I definitely took full advantage of it.
