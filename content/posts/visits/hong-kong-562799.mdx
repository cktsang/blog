Just got back from a 2½-week vacation in **Hong Kong and Beijing**! It had been ages since I last visited Hong Kong, but it felt almost exactly as I remembered — a little more modern, yet still full of its **quirky traditions**, like yelling to the minibus driver when it's your stop and rinsing your own chopsticks and bowls before dim sum. One big change, though, is the **expanded MTR system**. What once required a bus ride is now a quick metro trip, connecting major cities across the region. It's easily the best way to explore more of the country — and I definitely made the most of it.
