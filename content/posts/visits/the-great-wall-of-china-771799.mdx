"不到长城非好汉" (bú dào Chángchéng fēi hǎohàn) is a saying made famous by Chairman Mao. It means: "He who has never been to the Great Wall is not a true man".

So to the Great Wall I went.

## Transport

The part of the wall I've decided to visit was Badaling. Also known as the most accessible and popular part of the wall, because of the renovations done to the wall for "easier" walking (it was still a tough climb) and the ease of travel between the wall and the city center.

While a bus ride to Badaling or the less busy part of the wall, Mutianyu, would take more than two hours, a trip with the new High Speed Train would only take less than 30 minutes. With only a couple of days in Beijing, it would maximize the amount of places I could visit in a day. It would also be a great excuse to try out the High Speed Train!

The train departs every hours from the Beijing North Railway Station. I had to make sure to arrive on time, because the entry to the platform closes way before the departure time.

Upon arrival and after exiting the Badaling Railway Station there was no wall in sight. It was still hidden beyond the sea of trees and mountains.
