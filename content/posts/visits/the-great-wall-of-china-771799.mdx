"不到长城非好汉" (bú dào Chángchéng fēi hǎohàn) is a saying made famous by Chairman Mao. It means: "He who has never been to the Great Wall is not a true man".

So to the Great Wall I went.

## Transport

The part of the wall I've decided to visit was Badaling. Also known as the most accessible and popular part of the wall, because of the restorations done to the wall for "easier" walking (it was still a tough climb) and it's the most convenient part to travel to by public transport.

While a bus ride to Badaling or the less busy part of the wall, Mutianyu, would take more than two hours, a trip with the new High Speed Train would only take less than 30 minutes. With only a couple of days in Beijing, it would maximize the amount of places I could visit in a day. It would also be a great excuse to try out the High Speed Train!

The train departs from the Beijing North Railway Station. I had to make sure to arrive on time, because the entry to the platform closes way before the departure time.

Upon arrival and after exiting the Badaling Railway Station there was still no wall in sight. It was hidden beyond the sea of trees and mountains. A trip with the cable car took care of what would be a two hour hike to reach the Northern section of the wall and the view from above was great.

## To the top

Badaling's North 8th Tower was the destination. It's the highest point of the wall, standing 888 meters above sea level. Stairs with an incline over 60 degrees made for a tough climb. It was so steep, that you would just tumble down if not for the handrails. Much respect for all the elderly who were also making the climb at the same time. After reaching the tower and appreciating the effort it took to reach it, I quickly snatched a few pictures. Shortly after, it was time to move on and to venture beyond, because it was getting crowded. People weren't kidding when they said this was the most popular part of the wall and it wasn't even the high season yet.

It got a lot more quiet during the walk towards the next tower. The perfect time to catch my breath and snap a few pictures while enjoying the view. It was breathtaking to see the wall span across the mountains and realizing people have been building it up stone-by-stone in such a challenging environment.

This was definitely the highlight of my holiday in Beijing and a big recommendation to anyone visiting the city. Everyone should visit this place once in their lifetime. For those that aren’t able to so, I hope they enjoy the pictures down below.
