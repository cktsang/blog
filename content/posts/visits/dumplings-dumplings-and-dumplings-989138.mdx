A small dumpling spot serving up a dozen variations of authentic Chinese-style dumplings at an affordable price. Whether you prefer them steamed or grilled, both options are equally delicious and guaranteed to hit the spot!

Recommendation:

* Xiaolongbao (dumpling with soup inside—beware, the soup is hot!)
* Raviolis au porc, ciboulette et crevette grillé (dumplings with pork, chives and shrimp in the grilled option)
