I finally got to try Hart Bageri, which is supposed to be one of the best bakeries in Copenhagen, and it was actually so good. Their pastries are super light and probably some of the best I’ve ever had. You should definitely get there before they open because there’s usually a line, but they move pretty fast and have a few different spots around the city. It’s definitely worth the wait!

**Recommendations:**

* **Spandauer**
* **Cardamom Croissant**
