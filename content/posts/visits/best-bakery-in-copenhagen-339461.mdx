I had the pleasure of visiting **Hart Bageri**, one of the best bakeries in **Copenhagen**—and it did not disappoint! Their pastries are some of the lightest and most delicious I’ve ever tasted. Be prepared to queue up before opening, but don’t worry—they work fast, and you can find multiple locations across the city. Well worth the wait!

**Recommendations:**

* Spandauer
* Cardamom Croissant
