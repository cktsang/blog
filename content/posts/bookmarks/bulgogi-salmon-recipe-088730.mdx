I finally found the perfect salmon recipe for a sweet tooth like me—delicious yet healthy! After testing countless variations like garlic butter salmon, lemon garlic salmon, and honey garlic salmon, I always find myself coming back to this one. I've made a few tweaks to suit my taste, but you can check out the original recipe at the link below! Salmon has never tasted any better. 

**Ingredients:**

* 400 grams salmon fillet
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon mirin
* 1½ tablespoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 clove minced garlic
* 1 teaspoon grated ginger
* Generous amount of black pepper
