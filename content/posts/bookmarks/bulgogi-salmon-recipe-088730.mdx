I finally found a salmon recipe that’s perfect for my sweet tooth and actually healthy too. I’ve tried so many different kinds, like garlic butter, lemon garlic, and honey garlic, but I always end up coming back to this one. I changed it up a little bit to fit my taste and I use an air fryer to make it easier, but you can see the original recipe at the link below. Honestly, salmon has never tasted this good.

**Ingredients:**

* 2-3 salmon fillets
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon mirin
* 1½ tablespoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 clove minced garlic
* 1 teaspoon grated ginger
* Generous amount of black pepper

A quick 7-8 minutes in the airfryer at 200° Celcius, depending on the size of the fillets, for a delicious and healthy meal!
