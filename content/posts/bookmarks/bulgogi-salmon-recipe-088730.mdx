I finally found the perfect salmon recipe for a sweet tooth like me—delicious yet healthy! After testing countless variations like garlic butter salmon, lemon garlic salmon, and honey garlic salmon, I always find myself coming back to this one. I've made a few tweaks to suit my taste and use an airfryer for the convenience, but you can check out the original recipe at the link below! Salmon has never tasted any better.

**Ingredients:**

* 2-3 salmon fillets
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon mirin
* 1½ tablespoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 clove minced garlic
* 1 teaspoon grated ginger
* Generous amount of black pepper

A quick 7-8 minutes in the airfryer at 200° Celcius, depending on the size of the fillets, for a delicious and healthy meal!
