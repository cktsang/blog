I went from never running at all to finishing the 10K at the Rotterdam Marathon in only four months of training! It was a pretty big challenge since I had zero experience and a leg injury even slowed me down at the start. I really wanted to finish in under an hour, and I felt like I could actually do it. I just barely missed that goal, but crossing the finish line with a good time still felt like a massive win. Next up is trying to get a fast 5K time at a local Parkrun!
