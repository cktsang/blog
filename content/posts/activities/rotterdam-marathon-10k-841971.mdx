From zero to completing the 10K at the Rotterdam Marathon in just four months of training! A leg injury delayed my start, but I was determined to chase my goal of a sub-1 hour 10Kâ€”and it felt within reach. I just missed the mark, but crossing that finish line with a solid time still felt like a huge win. Next up: nailing a fast 5K at a local Parkrun!
