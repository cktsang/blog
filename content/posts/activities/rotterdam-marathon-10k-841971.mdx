From 0 to running the 10K at the Rotterdam Marathon with just four months of training. I was planning to start training a bit earlier, but a leg injury before the training started made things difficult. Still, I had a goal in mind of running a sub-1 hour 10K and it felt certainly doable. I just barely missed out on it, but Iâ€™m happy to have reached the finish line with a respectable time! Next step: getting a good time for the 5K in a local park run.
