My tennis elbow is still stopping me from playing badminton, but it’s feeling good enough that I can finally start hitting the gym again, at least for some light stuff. I can really tell I’ve lost some strength, but I’ve read it shouldn't take too long to get it back once I’m back in the swing of things. It is going to be a slow process, but I’m ready to get started.
