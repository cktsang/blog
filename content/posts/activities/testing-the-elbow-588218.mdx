I’ve just completed my first upper body workout in ages to see how the tennis elbow holds up after exercising.

1 minute rest per exercise and 3 minutes of rest between sets.

(Aug 21) **Edit:** I’m definitely still feeling the lingering effect of the workout. I’ll try to reduce the load in my next session to see if it has any effect.
