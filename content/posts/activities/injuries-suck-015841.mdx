I've been steadily improving at badminton—learning new shots and refining my movement each week. Unfortunately, a case of tennis elbow (ironically not from playing tennis) has put me on the sidelines. The culprit? Probably a mix of overusing smashes and less-than-perfect technique. To speed up recovery, I've been following the exercises in the video below. It looks like it’ll be a slow and painful process, but I’m determined to get back on the court and come back stronger with better technique.
