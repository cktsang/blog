I've been getting a lot better at badminton lately, learning new shots and working on my footwork every week. But I actually ended up with tennis elbow, which is funny since I don't even play tennis, and now I'm stuck on the sidelines. It was probably from smashing too much and having bad form. To help it heal faster, I’ve been doing the exercises in the video below. It looks like it’s going to be a slow and painful recovery, but I really want to get back on the court and play even better than before.
