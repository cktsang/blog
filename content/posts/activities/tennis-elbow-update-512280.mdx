Sadly, my tennis elbow injury, which has kept me away from badminton for almost a year, has been flaring up again. It's time to put a break on doing pull-ups and dips again, until further notice. The plan is to do the exercises from [this post](https://cktsang.vercel.app/activities/injuries-suck-015841) every single day until the injury is truly gone.
