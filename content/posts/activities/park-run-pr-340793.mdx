I just crushed my best Parkrun yet!  With a time of 22:13, I secured 9th place in the 5K. Huge shoutout to Ramon for pacing me and pushing me to go all out! Now, I can’t help but wonder—could a sub-20 minute run be within reach? It’s definitely a goal for the future, and hitting it would be an incredible milestone!
