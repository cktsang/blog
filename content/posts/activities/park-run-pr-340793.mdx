I just hit a new personal best at Parkrun! I finished the 5K in **22:13** and ended up in 9th place. Big thanks to Ramon for pacing me and making sure I didn't slow down. Now I'm starting to think about whether I could actually go under 20 minutes. It is definitely a goal I want to hit eventually, and it would be so cool to actually make it happen.
